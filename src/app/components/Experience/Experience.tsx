                Throughout my journey as a developer, I have gained expertise in
                a diverse set of Experience that empower me to build scalable,
                high-performance applications. From the front-end to the
                back-end, I leverage modern tools and frameworks to craft
                seamless user experiences and robust infrastructures.
                <br />
                <br /> Below is a selection of the key Experience Iâ€™ve worked
                with to bring projects to life.
