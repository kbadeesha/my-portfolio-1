                Throughout my journey as a developer, I have gained projertise in
                a diverse set of Projects that empower me to build scalable,
                high-performance applications. From the front-end to the
                back-end, I leverage modern tools and frameworks to craft
                seamless user Projectss and robust infrastructures.
                <br />
                <br /> Below is a selection of the key Projects Iâ€™ve worked
                with to bring projects to life.
